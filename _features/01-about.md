Aura Barrera, 19, from Oakland, CA, has attended very diverse public schools all her life, which sparked an interest in social issues and helping others. She then joined Girls Who Code because she wanted to explore computer science in a welcoming and inclusive environment, and was captivated by the chance to give back to her community in the San Francisco East Bay. She attends UC Berkeley where she is studying Computer Science and creating her own emphasis on technology for social good. 

She is an ambassador for organizations such as Code2040, Girls Who Code, Technolochicas, and Techbridge. On campus she is part of Computer Science Scholars, Fiat Lux Scholars, Hispanic Engineers and Scientists, and Society of Women Engineers.
